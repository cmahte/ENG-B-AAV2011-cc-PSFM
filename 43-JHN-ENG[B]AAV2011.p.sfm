\mt1 The Gospel According to John
\c 1
\p
\v 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
\p
\v 2 The same was in the beginning with God.
\p
\v 3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
\p
\v 4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
\p
\v 5 And the light shines in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.
\p
\v 6 ¶ There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
\p
\v 7 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.
\p
\v 8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.
\p
\v 9 That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.
\p
\v 10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
\p
\v 11 He came to his own, and his own received him not.
\p
\v 12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:
\p
\v 13 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
\p
\v 14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.
\p
\v 15 ¶ John bore witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.
\p
\v 16 And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.
\p
\v 17 For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 18 No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.
\p
\v 19 ¶ And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?
\p
\v 20 And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.
\p
\v 21 And they asked him, What then? Are you Elias? And he said, I am not. Are you that prophet? And he answered, No.
\p
\v 22 Then said they to him, Who are you? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What say you of yourself?
\p
\v 23 He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.
\p
\v 24 And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.
\p
\v 25 And they asked him, and said to him, Why baptize you then, if you be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?
\p
\v 26 John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there stands one among you, whom you know not;
\p
\v 27 He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's lace I am not worthy to unloose.
\p
\v 28 These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.
\p
\v 29 ¶ The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.
\p
\v 30 This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.
\p
\v 31 And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.
\p
\v 32 And John bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it stayed on him.
\p
\v 33 And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.
\p
\v 34 And I saw, and bore record that this is the Son of God.
\p
\v 35 ¶ Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;
\p
\v 36 And looking on Jesus as he walked, he said, Behold the Lamb of God!
\p
\v 37 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
\p
\v 38 Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, What seek you? They said to him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwell you?
\p
\v 39 He said to them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelled, and stayed with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.
\p
\v 40 One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
\p
\v 41 He first finds his own brother Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.
\p
\v 42 And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, You are Simon the son of Jona: you shall be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.
\p
\v 43 ¶ The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and finds Philip, and said to him, Follow me.
\p
\v 44 Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
\p
\v 45 Philip finds Nathanael, and said to him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
\p
\v 46 And Nathanael said to him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see.
\p
\v 47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!
\p
\v 48 Nathanael said to him, From where know you me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before that Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.
\p
\v 49 Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.
\p
\v 50 Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, believe you? you shall see greater things than these.
\p
\v 51 And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:
\p
\v 2 And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.
\p
\v 3 And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus said to him, They have no wine.
\p
\v 4 Jesus said to her, Woman, what have I to do with you? my hour is not yet come.
\p
\v 5 His mother said to the servants, Whatever he said to you, do it.
\p
\v 6 And there were set there six water pots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.
\p
\v 7 Jesus said to them, Fill the water pots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.
\p
\v 8 And he said to them, Draw out now, and bear to the governor of the feast. And they bore it.
\p
\v 9 When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not from where it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,
\p
\v 10 And said to him, Every man at the beginning does set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but you have kept the good wine until now.
\p
\v 11 This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
\p
\v 12 ¶ After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brothers, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 14 And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:
\p
\v 15 And when he had made a whip of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;
\p
\v 16 And said to them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.
\p
\v 17 And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of your house has eaten me up.
\p
\v 18 ¶ Then answered the Jews and said to him, What sign show you to us, seeing that you do these things?
\p
\v 19 Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.
\p
\v 20 Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and will you raise it up in three days?
\p
\v 21 But he spoke of the temple of his body.
\p
\v 22 When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this to them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
\p
\v 23 ¶ Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.
\p
\v 24 But Jesus did not commit himself to them, because he knew all men,
\p
\v 25 And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:
\p
\v 2 The same came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that you do, except God be with him.
\p
\v 3 Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 4 Nicodemus said to him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?
\p
\v 5 Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
\p
\v 7 Marvel not that I said to you, You must be born again.
\p
\v 8 The wind blows where it wants, and you hear the sound thereof, but can not tell from where it comes, and where it goes: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
\p
\v 9 Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be?
\p
\v 10 Jesus answered and said to him, Are you a master of Israel, and know not these things?
\p
\v 11 Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and you receive not our witness.
\p
\v 12 If I have told you earthly things, and you believe not, how shall you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?
\p
\v 13 And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.
\p
\v 14 ¶ And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:
\p
\v 15 That whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
\p
\v 16 ¶ For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
\p
\v 17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
\p
\v 18 ¶ He that believes on him is not condemned: but he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
\p
\v 19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
\p
\v 20 For every one that does evil hates the light, neither comes to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.
\p
\v 21 But he that does truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are worked in God.
\p
\v 22 ¶ After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.
\p
\v 23 ¶ And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.
\p
\v 24 For John was not yet cast into prison.
\p
\v 25 ¶ Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.
\p
\v 26 And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with you beyond Jordan, to whom you bore witness, behold, the same baptizes, and all men come to him.
\p
\v 27 John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.
\p
\v 28 You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.
\p
\v 29 He that has the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.
\p
\v 30 He must increase, but I must decrease.
\p
\v 31 He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaks of the earth: he that comes from heaven is above all.
\p
\v 32 And what he has seen and heard, that he testifies; and no man receives his testimony.
\p
\v 33 He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that God is true.
\p
\v 34 For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God: for God gives not the Spirit by measure to him.
\p
\v 35 The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.
\p
\v 36 He that believes on the Son has everlasting life: and he that believes not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God stays on him.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,
\p
\v 2 (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)
\p
\v 3 He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.
\p
\v 4 And he must needs go through Samaria.
\p
\v 5 Then comes he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
\p
\v 6 Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.
\p
\v 7 There comes a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus said to her, Give me to drink.
\p
\v 8 (For his disciples were gone away to the city to buy meat.)
\p
\v 9 Then said the woman of Samaria to him, How is it that you, being a Jew, ask drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.
\p
\v 10 Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that said to you, Give me to drink; you would have asked of him, and he would have given you living water.
\p
\v 11 The woman said to him, Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from where then have you that living water?
\p
\v 12 Are you greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?
\p
\v 13 Jesus answered and said to her, Whoever drinks of this water shall thirst again:
\p
\v 14 But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
\p
\v 15 The woman said to him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come here to draw.
\p
\v 16 Jesus said to her, Go, call your husband, and come here.
\p
\v 17 The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, You have well said, I have no husband:
\p
\v 18 For you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband: in that said you truly.
\p
\v 19 The woman said to him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.
\p
\v 20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and you say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
\p
\v 21 Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.
\p
\v 22 You worship you know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.
\p
\v 23 But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeks such to worship him.
\p
\v 24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.
\p
\v 25 The woman said to him, I know that Messias comes, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.
\p
\v 26 Jesus said to her, I that speak to you am he.
\p
\v 27 ¶ And on this came his disciples, and marveled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seek you? or, Why talk you with her?
\p
\v 28 The woman then left her water pot, and went her way into the city, and said to the men,
\p
\v 29 Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?
\p
\v 30 Then they went out of the city, and came to him.
\p
\v 31 ¶ In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.
\p
\v 32 But he said to them, I have meat to eat that you know not of.
\p
\v 33 Therefore said the disciples one to another, Has any man brought him ought to eat?
\p
\v 34 Jesus said to them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
\p
\v 35 Say not you, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.
\p
\v 36 And he that reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to life eternal: that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together.
\p
\v 37 And herein is that saying true, One sows, and another reaps.
\p
\v 38 I sent you to reap that where on you bestowed no labor: other men labored, and you are entered into their labors.
\p
\v 39 ¶ And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.
\p
\v 40 So when the Samaritans were come to him, they sought him that he would tarry with them: and he stayed there two days.
\p
\v 41 And many more believed because of his own word;
\p
\v 42 And said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of your saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.
\p
\v 43 ¶ Now after two days he departed there, and went into Galilee.
\p
\v 44 For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
\p
\v 45 Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went to the feast.
\p
\v 46 So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
\p
\v 47 When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went to him, and sought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.
\p
\v 48 Then said Jesus to him, Except you see signs and wonders, you will not believe.
\p
\v 49 The nobleman said to him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
\p
\v 50 Jesus said to him, Go your way; your son lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken to him, and he went his way.
\p
\v 51 And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Your son lives.
\p
\v 52 Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
\p
\v 53 So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said to him, Your son lives: and himself believed, and his whole house.
\p
\v 54 This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 2 Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.
\p
\v 3 In these lay a great multitude of weak folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
\p
\v 4 For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatever disease he had.
\p
\v 5 And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.
\p
\v 6 When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he said to him, Will you be made whole?
\p
\v 7 The weak man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steps down before me.
\p
\v 8 Jesus said to him, Rise, take up your bed, and walk.
\p
\v 9 And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.
\p
\v 10 ¶ The Jews therefore said to him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.
\p
\v 11 He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said to me, Take up your bed, and walk.
\p
\v 12 Then asked they him, What man is that which said to you, Take up your bed, and walk?
\p
\v 13 And he that was healed knew not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.
\p
\v 14 Afterward Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, you are made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come to you.
\p
\v 15 The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.
\p
\v 16 And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.
\p
\v 17 ¶ But Jesus answered them, My Father works till now, and I work.
\p
\v 18 Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.
\p
\v 19 Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do: for what things soever he does, these also does the Son likewise.
\p
\v 20 For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that himself does: and he will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.
\p
\v 21 For as the Father raises up the dead, and vivifies them; even so the Son vivifies whom he will.
\p
\v 22 For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son:
\p
\v 23 That all men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He that honors not the Son honors not the Father which has sent him.
\p
\v 24 Truly, truly, I say to you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death to life.
\p
\v 25 Truly, truly, I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.
\p
\v 26 For as the Father has life in himself; so has he given to the Son to have life in himself;
\p
\v 27 And has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.
\p
\v 28 Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
\p
\v 29 And shall come forth; they that have done good, to the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, to the resurrection of damnation.
\p
\v 30 I can of my own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father which has sent me.
\p
\v 31 If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
\p
\v 32 ¶ There is another that bears witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true.
\p
\v 33 You sent to John, and he bore witness to the truth.
\p
\v 34 But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that you might be saved.
\p
\v 35 He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.
\p
\v 36 ¶ But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.
\p
\v 37 And the Father himself, which has sent me, has borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.
\p
\v 38 And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he has sent, him you believe not.
\p
\v 39 ¶ Search the scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.
\p
\v 40 And you will not come to me, that you might have life.
\p
\v 41 I receive not honor from men.
\p
\v 42 But I know you, that you have not the love of God in you.
\p
\v 43 I am come in my Father's name, and you receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him you will receive.
\p
\v 44 How can you believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor that comes from God only?
\p
\v 45 Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom you trust.
\p
\v 46 For had you believed Moses, you would have believed me; for he wrote of me.
\p
\v 47 But if you believe not his writings, how shall you believe my words?
\c 6
\p
\v 1 After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.
\p
\v 2 And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.
\p
\v 3 And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.
\p
\v 4 And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.
\p
\v 5 ¶ When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come to him, he said to Philip, From where shall we buy bread, that these may eat?
\p
\v 6 And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.
\p
\v 7 Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.
\p
\v 8 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him,
\p
\v 9 There is a lad here, which has five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?
\p
\v 10 And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
\p
\v 11 And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.
\p
\v 12 When they were filled, he said to his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.
\p
\v 13 Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above to them that had eaten.
\p
\v 14 Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.
\p
\v 15 ¶ When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.
\p
\v 16 And when even was now come, his disciples went down to the sea,
\p
\v 17 And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.
\p
\v 18 And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.
\p
\v 19 So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the ship: and they were afraid.
\p
\v 20 But he said to them, It is I; be not afraid.
\p
\v 21 Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land where they went.
\p
\v 22 ¶ The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one into where his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;
\p
\v 23 (However, there came other boats from Tiberias near to the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)
\p
\v 24 When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.
\p
\v 25 And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when came you here?
\p
\v 26 Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, You seek me, not because you saw the miracles, but because you did eat of the loaves, and were filled.
\p
\v 27 Labor not for the meat which perishes, but for that meat which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give to you: for him has God the Father sealed.
\p
\v 28 Then said they to him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?
\p
\v 29 Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you believe on him whom he has sent.
\p
\v 30 They said therefore to him, What sign show you then, that we may see, and believe you? what do you work?
\p
\v 31 Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
\p
\v 32 Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.
\p
\v 33 For the bread of God is he which comes down from heaven, and gives life to the world.
\p
\v 34 Then said they to him, Lord, ever more give us this bread.
\p
\v 35 And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he that comes to me shall never hunger; and he that believes on me shall never thirst.
\p
\v 36 But I said to you, That you also have seen me, and believe not.
\p
\v 37 All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and him that comes to me I will in no wise cast out.
\p
\v 38 For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.
\p
\v 39 And this is the Father's will which has sent me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.
\p
\v 40 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which sees the Son, and believes on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.
\p
\v 41 The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.
\p
\v 42 And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he said, I came down from heaven?
\p
\v 43 Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Murmur not among yourselves.
\p
\v 44 No man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.
\p
\v 45 It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that has heard, and has learned of the Father, comes to me.
\p
\v 46 Not that any man has seen the Father, save he which is of God, he has seen the Father.
\p
\v 47 Truly, truly, I say to you, He that believes on me has everlasting life.
\p
\v 48 I am that bread of life.
\p
\v 49 Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.
\p
\v 50 This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.
\p
\v 51 I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.
\p
\v 52 The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?
\p
\v 53 Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.
\p
\v 54 Whoever eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
\p
\v 55 For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
\p
\v 56 He that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, dwells in me, and I in him.
\p
\v 57 As the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eats me, even he shall live by me.
\p
\v 58 This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eats of this bread shall live for ever.
\p
\v 59 These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
\p
\v 60 Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?
\p
\v 61 When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said to them, Does this offend you?
\p
\v 62 What and if you shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?
\p
\v 63 It is the spirit that vivifies; the flesh profits nothing: the words that I speak to you, they are spirit, and they are life.
\p
\v 64 But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.
\p
\v 65 And he said, Therefore said I to you, that no man can come to me, except it were given to him of my Father.
\p
\v 66 ¶ From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.
\p
\v 67 Then said Jesus to the twelve, Will you also go away?
\p
\v 68 Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? you have the words of eternal life.
\p
\v 69 And we believe and are sure that you are that Christ, the Son of the living God.
\p
\v 70 Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?
\p
\v 71 He spoke of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.
\p
\v 2 Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.
\p
\v 3 His brothers therefore said to him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that your disciples also may see the works that you do.
\p
\v 4 For there is no man that does any thing in secret, and he himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.
\p
\v 5 For neither did his brothers believe in him.
\p
\v 6 Then Jesus said to them, My time is not yet come: but your time is always ready.
\p
\v 7 The world cannot hate you; but me it hates, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.
\p
\v 8 Go you up to this feast: I go not up yet to this feast: for my time is not yet full come.
\p
\v 9 When he had said these words to them, he stayed still in Galilee.
\p
\v 10 ¶ But when his brothers were gone up, then went he also up to the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.
\p
\v 11 Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
\p
\v 12 And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, No; but he deceives the people.
\p
\v 13 However, no man spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.
\p
\v 14 ¶ Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
\p
\v 15 And the Jews marveled, saying, How knows this man letters, having never learned?
\p
\v 16 Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.
\p
\v 17 If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.
\p
\v 18 He that speaks of himself seeks his own glory: but he that seeks his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
\p
\v 19 Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why go you about to kill me?
\p
\v 20 The people answered and said, You have a devil: who goes about to kill you?
\p
\v 21 Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one work, and you all marvel.
\p
\v 22 Moses therefore gave to you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and you on the sabbath day circumcise a man.
\p
\v 23 If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are you angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?
\p
\v 24 Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
\p
\v 25 Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?
\p
\v 26 But, see, he speaks boldly, and they say nothing to him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?
\p
\v 27 However, we know this man from where he is: but when Christ comes, no man knows from where he is.
\p
\v 28 Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, You both know me, and you know from where I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom you know not.
\p
\v 29 But I know him: for I am from him, and he has sent me.
\p
\v 30 Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
\p
\v 31 And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ comes, will he do more miracles than these which this man has done?
\p
\v 32 ¶ The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.
\p
\v 33 Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go to him that sent me.
\p
\v 34 You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come.
\p
\v 35 Then said the Jews among themselves, Where will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go to the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?
\p
\v 36 What manner of saying is this that he said, You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come?
\p
\v 37 In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.
\p
\v 38 He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.
\p
\v 39 (But this spoke he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)
\p
\v 40 ¶ Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.
\p
\v 41 Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?
\p
\v 42 Has not the scripture said, That Christ comes of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?
\p
\v 43 So there was a division among the people because of him.
\p
\v 44 And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
\p
\v 45 ¶ Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why have you not brought him?
\p
\v 46 The officers answered, Never man spoke like this man.
\p
\v 47 Then answered them the Pharisees, Are you also deceived?
\p
\v 48 Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?
\p
\v 49 But this people who knows not the law are cursed.
\p
\v 50 Nicodemus said to them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)
\p
\v 51 Does our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he does?
\p
\v 52 They answered and said to him, Are you also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee rises no prophet.
\p
\v 53 And every man went to his own house.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 Jesus went to the mount of Olives.
\p
\v 2 And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him; and he sat down, and taught them.
\p
\v 3 And the scribes and Pharisees brought to him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the middle,
\p
\v 4 They say to him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.
\p
\v 5 Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what say you?
\p
\v 6 This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.
\p
\v 7 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said to them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.
\p
\v 8 And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
\p
\v 9 And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the oldest, even to the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the middle.
\p
\v 10 When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said to her, Woman, where are those your accusers? has no man condemned you?
\p
\v 11 She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn you: go, and sin no more.
\p
\v 12 ¶ Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
\p
\v 13 The Pharisees therefore said to him, You bore record of yourself; your record is not true.
\p
\v 14 Jesus answered and said to them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know from where I came, and where I go; but you cannot tell from where I come, and where I go.
\p
\v 15 You judge after the flesh; I judge no man.
\p
\v 16 And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.
\p
\v 17 It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.
\p
\v 18 I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me bears witness of me.
\p
\v 19 Then said they to him, Where is your Father? Jesus answered, You neither know me, nor my Father: if you had known me, you should have known my Father also.
\p
\v 20 These words spoke Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.
\p
\v 21 Then said Jesus again to them, I go my way, and you shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: where I go, you cannot come.
\p
\v 22 Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he said, Where I go, you cannot come.
\p
\v 23 And he said to them, You are from beneath; I am from above: you are of this world; I am not of this world.
\p
\v 24 I said therefore to you, that you shall die in your sins: for if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sins.
\p
\v 25 Then said they to him, Who are you? And Jesus said to them, Even the same that I said to you from the beginning.
\p
\v 26 I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.
\p
\v 27 They understood not that he spoke to them of the Father.
\p
\v 28 Then said Jesus to them, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father has taught me, I speak these things.
\p
\v 29 And he that sent me is with me: the Father has not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.
\p
\v 30 As he spoke these words, many believed on him.
\p
\v 31 Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If you continue in my word, then are you my disciples indeed;
\p
\v 32 And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
\p
\v 33 ¶ They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how say you, You shall be made free?
\p
\v 34 Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Whoever commits sin is the servant of sin.
\p
\v 35 And the servant stays not in the house for ever: but the Son stays ever.
\p
\v 36 If the Son therefore shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.
\p
\v 37 I know that you are Abraham's seed; but you seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.
\p
\v 38 I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you do that which you have seen with your father.
\p
\v 39 They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.
\p
\v 40 But now you seek to kill me, a man that has told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.
\p
\v 41 You do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.
\p
\v 42 Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.
\p
\v 43 Why do you not understand my speech? even because you cannot hear my word.
\p
\v 44 You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stayed not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.
\p
\v 45 And because I tell you the truth, you believe me not.
\p
\v 46 Which of you convinces me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do you not believe me?
\p
\v 47 He that is of God hears God's words: you therefore hear them not, because you are not of God.
\p
\v 48 Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Say we not well that you are a Samaritan, and have a devil?
\p
\v 49 Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honor my Father, and you do dishonor me.
\p
\v 50 And I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeks and judges.
\p
\v 51 Truly, truly, I say to you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.
\p
\v 52 Then said the Jews to him, Now we know that you have a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and you say, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.
\p
\v 53 Are you greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom make you yourself?
\p
\v 54 Jesus answered, If I honor myself, my honor is nothing: it is my Father that honors me; of whom you say, that he is your God:
\p
\v 55 Yet you have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like to you: but I know him, and keep his saying.
\p
\v 56 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.
\p
\v 57 Then said the Jews to him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?
\p
\v 58 Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am.
\p
\v 59 Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the middle of them, and so passed by.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.
\p
\v 2 And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?
\p
\v 3 Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.
\p
\v 4 I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night comes, when no man can work.
\p
\v 5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
\p
\v 6 When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,
\p
\v 7 And said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.
\p
\v 8 The neighbors therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?
\p
\v 9 Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.
\p
\v 10 Therefore said they to him, How were your eyes opened?
\p
\v 11 He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.
\p
\v 12 Then said they to him, Where is he? He said, I know not.
\p
\v 13 They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
\p
\v 14 And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
\p
\v 15 Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said to them, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and do see.
\p
\v 16 Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keeps not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.
\p
\v 17 They say to the blind man again, What say you of him, that he has opened your eyes? He said, He is a prophet.
\p
\v 18 But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.
\p
\v 19 And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who you say was born blind? how then does he now see?
\p
\v 20 His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
\p
\v 21 But by what means he now sees, we know not; or who has opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.
\p
\v 22 These words spoke his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
\p
\v 23 Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
\p
\v 24 Then again called they the man that was blind, and said to him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.
\p
\v 25 He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.
\p
\v 26 Then said they to him again, What did he to you? how opened he your eyes?
\p
\v 27 He answered them, I have told you already, and you did not hear: why would you hear it again? will you also be his disciples?
\p
\v 28 Then they reviled him, and said, You are his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.
\p
\v 29 We know that God spoke to Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from where he is.
\p
\v 30 The man answered and said to them, Why herein is a marvelous thing, that you know not from where he is, and yet he has opened my eyes.
\p
\v 31 Now we know that God hears not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and does his will, him he hears.
\p
\v 32 Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.
\p
\v 33 If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.
\p
\v 34 They answered and said to him, You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us? And they cast him out.
\p
\v 35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said to him, Do you believe on the Son of God?
\p
\v 36 He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?
\p
\v 37 And Jesus said to him, You have both seen him, and it is he that talks with you.
\p
\v 38 And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.
\p
\v 39 And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.
\p
\v 40 And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said to him, Are we blind also?
\p
\v 41 Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you should have no sin: but now you say, We see; therefore your sin remains.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Truly, truly, I say to you, He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.
\p
\v 2 But he that enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
\p
\v 3 To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.
\p
\v 4 And when he puts forth his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.
\p
\v 5 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.
\p
\v 6 This parable spoke Jesus to them: but they understood not what things they were which he spoke to them.
\p
\v 7 Then said Jesus to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.
\p
\v 8 All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.
\p
\v 9 I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
\p
\v 10 The thief comes not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.
\p
\v 11 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.
\p
\v 12 But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees: and the wolf catches them, and scatters the sheep.
\p
\v 13 The hireling flees, because he is an hireling, and cares not for the sheep.
\p
\v 14 I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.
\p
\v 15 As the Father knows me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.
\p
\v 16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.
\p
\v 17 Therefore does my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.
\p
\v 18 No man takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.
\p
\v 19 There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.
\p
\v 20 And many of them said, He has a devil, and is mad; why hear you him?
\p
\v 21 Others said, These are not the words of him that has a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?
\p
\v 22 ¶ And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.
\p
\v 23 And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.
\p
\v 24 Then came the Jews round about him, and said to him, How long do you make us to doubt? If you be the Christ, tell us plainly.
\p
\v 25 Jesus answered them, I told you, and you believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.
\p
\v 26 But you believe not, because you are not of my sheep, as I said to you.
\p
\v 27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
\p
\v 28 And I give to them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.
\p
\v 29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.
\p
\v 30 I and my Father are one.
\p
\v 31 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.
\p
\v 32 Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you from my Father; for which of those works do you stone me?
\p
\v 33 The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone you not; but for blasphemy; and because that you, being a man, make yourself God.
\p
\v 34 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, You are gods?
\p
\v 35 If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;
\p
\v 36 Say you of him, whom the Father has sanctified, and sent into the world, You blaspheme; because I said, I am the Son of God?
\p
\v 37 If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
\p
\v 38 But if I do, though you believe not me, believe the works: that you may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.
\p
\v 39 Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,
\p
\v 40 And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he stayed.
\p
\v 41 And many resorted to him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spoke of this man were true.
\p
\v 42 And many believed on him there.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.
\p
\v 2 (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
\p
\v 3 Therefore his sisters sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom you love is sick.
\p
\v 4 When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.
\p
\v 5 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
\p
\v 6 When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he stayed two days still in the same place where he was.
\p
\v 7 Then after that said he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.
\p
\v 8 His disciples say to him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone you; and go you thither again?
\p
\v 9 Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbles not, because he sees the light of this world.
\p
\v 10 But if a man walk in the night, he stumbles, because there is no light in him.
\p
\v 11 These things said he: and after that he said to them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.
\p
\v 12 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.
\p
\v 13 However, Jesus spoke of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.
\p
\v 14 Then said Jesus to them plainly, Lazarus is dead.
\p
\v 15 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent you may believe; nevertheless let us go to him.
\p
\v 16 Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.
\p
\v 17 Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.
\p
\v 18 Now Bethany was near to Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:
\p
\v 19 And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
\p
\v 20 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.
\p
\v 21 Then said Martha to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother had not died.
\p
\v 22 But I know, that even now, whatever you will ask of God, God will give it you.
\p
\v 23 Jesus said to her, Your brother shall rise again.
\p
\v 24 Martha said to him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
\p
\v 25 Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believes in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
\p
\v 26 And whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Believe you this?
\p
\v 27 She said to him, Yes, Lord: I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.
\p
\v 28 And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calls for you.
\p
\v 29 As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came to him.
\p
\v 30 Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.
\p
\v 31 The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goes to the grave to weep there.
\p
\v 32 Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if you had been here, my brother had not died.
\p
\v 33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.
\p
\v 34 And said, Where have you laid him? They said to him, Lord, come and see.
\p
\v 35 Jesus wept.
\p
\v 36 Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!
\p
\v 37 And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?
\p
\v 38 Jesus therefore again groaning in himself comes to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay on it.
\p
\v 39 Jesus said, Take you away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, said to him, Lord, by this time he stinks: for he has been dead four days.
\p
\v 40 Jesus said to her, Said I not to you, that, if you would believe, you should see the glory of God?
\p
\v 41 Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank you that you have heard me.
\p
\v 42 And I knew that you hear me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that you have sent me.
\p
\v 43 And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.
\p
\v 44 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave clothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus said to them, Loose him, and let him go.
\p
\v 45 Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.
\p
\v 46 But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.
\p
\v 47 ¶ Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man does many miracles.
\p
\v 48 If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.
\p
\v 49 And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said to them, You know nothing at all,
\p
\v 50 Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.
\p
\v 51 And this spoke he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;
\p
\v 52 And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.
\p
\v 53 Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.
\p
\v 54 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went there to a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.
\p
\v 55 ¶ And the Jews' passover was near at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.
\p
\v 56 Then sought they for Jesus, and spoke among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think you, that he will not come to the feast?
\p
\v 57 Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should show it, that they might take him.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.
\p
\v 2 There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.
\p
\v 3 Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.
\p
\v 4 Then said one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,
\p
\v 5 Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?
\p
\v 6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bore what was put therein.
\p
\v 7 Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying has she kept this.
\p
\v 8 For the poor always you have with you; but me you have not always.
\p
\v 9 Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
\p
\v 10 ¶ But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;
\p
\v 11 Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
\p
\v 12 ¶ On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
\p
\v 13 Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that comes in the name of the Lord.
\p
\v 14 And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,
\p
\v 15 Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, your King comes, sitting on an ass's colt.
\p
\v 16 These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him.
\p
\v 17 The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bore record.
\p
\v 18 For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.
\p
\v 19 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive you how you prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.
\p
\v 20 ¶ And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:
\p
\v 21 The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.
\p
\v 22 Philip comes and tells Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.
\p
\v 23 ¶ And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.
\p
\v 24 Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it stays alone: but if it die, it brings forth much fruit.
\p
\v 25 He that loves his life shall lose it; and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal.
\p
\v 26 If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honor.
\p
\v 27 Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I to this hour.
\p
\v 28 Father, glorify your name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.
\p
\v 29 The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spoke to him.
\p
\v 30 Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.
\p
\v 31 Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
\p
\v 32 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me.
\p
\v 33 This he said, signifying what death he should die.
\p
\v 34 The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ stays for ever: and how say you, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?
\p
\v 35 Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness come on you: for he that walks in darkness knows not where he goes.
\p
\v 36 While you have light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light. These things spoke Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.
\p
\v 37 ¶ But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:
\p
\v 38 That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
\p
\v 39 Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,
\p
\v 40 He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
\p
\v 41 These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.
\p
\v 42 ¶ Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:
\p
\v 43 For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.
\p
\v 44 ¶ Jesus cried and said, He that believes on me, believes not on me, but on him that sent me.
\p
\v 45 And he that sees me sees him that sent me.
\p
\v 46 I am come a light into the world, that whoever believes on me should not abide in darkness.
\p
\v 47 And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
\p
\v 48 He that rejects me, and receives not my words, has one that judges him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.
\p
\v 49 For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.
\p
\v 50 And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatever I speak therefore, even as the Father said to me, so I speak.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them to the end.
\p
\v 2 And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;
\p
\v 3 Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;
\p
\v 4 He rises from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.
\p
\v 5 After that he pours water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.
\p
\v 6 Then comes he to Simon Peter: and Peter said to him, Lord, do you wash my feet?
\p
\v 7 Jesus answered and said to him, What I do you know not now; but you shall know hereafter.
\p
\v 8 Peter said to him, You shall never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash you not, you have no part with me.
\p
\v 9 Simon Peter said to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.
\p
\v 10 Jesus said to him, He that is washed needs not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and you are clean, but not all.
\p
\v 11 For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, You are not all clean.
\p
\v 12 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said to them, Know you what I have done to you?
\p
\v 13 You call me Master and Lord: and you say well; for so I am.
\p
\v 14 If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; you also ought to wash one another's feet.
\p
\v 15 For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.
\p
\v 16 Truly, truly, I say to you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.
\p
\v 17 If you know these things, happy are you if you do them.
\p
\v 18 ¶ I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.
\p
\v 19 Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, you may believe that I am he.
\p
\v 20 Truly, truly, I say to you, He that receives whomsoever I send receives me; and he that receives me receives him that sent me.
\p
\v 21 When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you shall betray me.
\p
\v 22 Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spoke.
\p
\v 23 Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.
\p
\v 24 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spoke.
\p
\v 25 He then lying on Jesus' breast said to him, Lord, who is it?
\p
\v 26 Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
\p
\v 27 And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus to him, That you do, do quickly.
\p
\v 28 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spoke this to him.
\p
\v 29 For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said to him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.
\p
\v 30 He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.
\p
\v 31 ¶ Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.
\p
\v 32 If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.
\p
\v 33 Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek me: and as I said to the Jews, Where I go, you cannot come; so now I say to you.
\p
\v 34 A new commandment I give to you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.
\p
\v 35 By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one to another.
\p
\v 36 ¶ Simon Peter said to him, Lord, where go you? Jesus answered him, Where I go, you can not follow me now; but you shall follow me afterwards.
\p
\v 37 Peter said to him, Lord, why cannot I follow you now? I will lay down my life for your sake.
\p
\v 38 Jesus answered him, Will you lay down your life for my sake? Truly, truly, I say to you, The cock shall not crow, till you have denied me thrice.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 Let not your heart be troubled: you believe in God, believe also in me.
\p
\v 2 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
\p
\v 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to myself; that where I am, there you may be also.
\p
\v 4 And where I go you know, and the way you know.
\p
\v 5 Thomas said to him, Lord, we know not where you go; and how can we know the way?
\p
\v 6 Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me.
\p
\v 7 If you had known me, you should have known my Father also: and from now on you know him, and have seen him.
\p
\v 8 Philip said to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it suffises us.
\p
\v 9 Jesus said to him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet have you not known me, Philip? he that has seen me has seen the Father; and how say you then, Show us the Father?
\p
\v 10 Believe you not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak to you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwells in me, he does the works.
\p
\v 11 Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.
\p
\v 12 Truly, truly, I say to you, He that believes on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go to my Father.
\p
\v 13 And whatever you shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
\p
\v 14 If you shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.
\p
\v 15 ¶ If you love me, keep my commandments.
\p
\v 16 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;
\p
\v 17 Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it sees him not, neither knows him: but you know him; for he dwells with you, and shall be in you.
\p
\v 18 I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.
\p
\v 19 Yet a little while, and the world sees me no more; but you see me: because I live, you shall live also.
\p
\v 20 At that day you shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.
\p
\v 21 He that has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me: and he that loves me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
\p
\v 22 Judas said to him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?
\p
\v 23 Jesus answered and said to him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our stayed with him.
\p
\v 24 He that loves me not keeps not my sayings: and the word which you hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.
\p
\v 25 These things have I spoken to you, being yet present with you.
\p
\v 26 But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.
\p
\v 27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you: not as the world gives, give I to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
\p
\v 28 You have heard how I said to you, I go away, and come again to you. If you loved me, you would rejoice, because I said, I go to the Father: for my Father is greater than I.
\p
\v 29 And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, you might believe.
\p
\v 30 Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.
\p
\v 31 But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer.
\p
\v 2 Every branch in me that bears not fruit he takes away: and every branch that bears fruit, he purges it, that it may bring forth more fruit.
\p
\v 3 Now you are clean through the word which I have spoken to you.
\p
\v 4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can you, except you abide in me.
\p
\v 5 I am the vine, you are the branches: He that stays in me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit: for without me you can do nothing.
\p
\v 6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.
\p
\v 7 If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, you shall ask what you will, and it shall be done to you.
\p
\v 8 Herein is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; so shall you be my disciples.
\p
\v 9 As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you: continue you in my love.
\p
\v 10 If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.
\p
\v 11 These things have I spoken to you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.
\p
\v 12 This is my commandment, That you love one another, as I have loved you.
\p
\v 13 Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
\p
\v 14 You are my friends, if you do whatever I command you.
\p
\v 15 From now on I call you not servants; for the servant knows not what his lord does: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known to you.
\p
\v 16 You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatever you shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.
\p
\v 17 These things I command you, that you love one another.
\p
\v 18 If the world hate you, you know that it hated me before it hated you.
\p
\v 19 If you were of the world, the world would love his own: but because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.
\p
\v 20 Remember the word that I said to you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.
\p
\v 21 But all these things will they do to you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.
\p
\v 22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.
\p
\v 23 He that hates me hates my Father also.
\p
\v 24 If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.
\p
\v 25 But this comes to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.
\p
\v 26 But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me:
\p
\v 27 And you also shall bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 These things have I spoken to you, that you should not be offended.
\p
\v 2 They shall put you out of the synagogues: yes, the time comes, that whoever kills you will think that he does God service.
\p
\v 3 And these things will they do to you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.
\p
\v 4 But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, you may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not to you at the beginning, because I was with you.
\p
\v 5 But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asks me, Where go you?
\p
\v 6 But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.
\p
\v 7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you.
\p
\v 8 And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:
\p
\v 9 Of sin, because they believe not on me;
\p
\v 10 Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and you see me no more;
\p
\v 11 Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.
\p
\v 12 I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.
\p
\v 13 However, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.
\p
\v 14 He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall show it to you.
\p
\v 15 All things that the Father has are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall show it to you.
\p
\v 16 A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me, because I go to the Father.
\p
\v 17 Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he said to us, A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?
\p
\v 18 They said therefore, What is this that he said, A little while? we cannot tell what he said.
\p
\v 19 Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said to them, Do you inquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me?
\p
\v 20 Truly, truly, I say to you, That you shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and you shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
\p
\v 21 A woman when she is in travail has sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembers no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.
\p
\v 22 And you now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man takes from you.
\p
\v 23 And in that day you shall ask me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, Whatever you shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.
\p
\v 24 Till now have you asked nothing in my name: ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be full.
\p
\v 25 These things have I spoken to you in proverbs: but the time comes, when I shall no more speak to you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly of the Father.
\p
\v 26 At that day you shall ask in my name: and I say not to you, that I will pray the Father for you:
\p
\v 27 For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.
\p
\v 28 I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.
\p
\v 29 His disciples said to him, See, now speak you plainly, and speak no proverb.
\p
\v 30 Now are we sure that you know all things, and need not that any man should ask you: by this we believe that you came forth from God.
\p
\v 31 Jesus answered them, Do you now believe?
\p
\v 32 Behold, the hour comes, yes, is now come, that you shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
\p
\v 33 These things I have spoken to you, that in me you might have peace. In the world you shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.
\c 17
\p
\v 1 These words spoke Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify your Son, that your Son also may glorify you:
\p
\v 2 As you have given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as you have given him.
\p
\v 3 And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.
\p
\v 4 I have glorified you on the earth: I have finished the work which you gave me to do.
\p
\v 5 And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.
\p
\v 6 I have manifested your name to the men which you gave me out of the world: your they were, and you gave them me; and they have kept your word.
\p
\v 7 Now they have known that all things whatever you have given me are of you.
\p
\v 8 For I have given to them the words which you gave me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from you, and they have believed that you did send me.
\p
\v 9 I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which you have given me; for they are yours.
\p
\v 10 And all my are yours, and your are mine; and I am glorified in them.
\p
\v 11 And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to you. Holy Father, keep through your own name those whom you have given me, that they may be one, as we are.
\p
\v 12 While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name: those that you gave me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.
\p
\v 13 And now come I to you; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.
\p
\v 14 I have given them your word; and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
\p
\v 15 I pray not that you should take them out of the world, but that you should keep them from the evil.
\p
\v 16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
\p
\v 17 Sanctify them through your truth: your word is truth.
\p
\v 18 As you have sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.
\p
\v 19 And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.
\p
\v 20 Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;
\p
\v 21 That they all may be one; as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that you have sent me.
\p
\v 22 And the glory which you gave me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:
\p
\v 23 I in them, and you in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that you have sent me, and have loved them, as you have loved me.
\p
\v 24 Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.
\p
\v 25 O righteous Father, the world has not known you: but I have known you, and these have known that you have sent me.
\p
\v 26 And I have declared to them your name, and will declare it: that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.
\c 18
\p
\v 1 When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.
\p
\v 2 And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus often resorted thither with his disciples.
\p
\v 3 Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, comes thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.
\p
\v 4 Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come on him, went forth, and said to them, Whom seek you?
\p
\v 5 They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus said to them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.
\p
\v 6 As soon then as he had said to them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.
\p
\v 7 Then asked he them again, Whom seek you? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.
\p
\v 8 Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore you seek me, let these go their way:
\p
\v 9 That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Of them which you gave me have I lost none.
\p
\v 10 Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.
\p
\v 11 Then said Jesus to Peter, Put up your sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father has given me, shall I not drink it?
\p
\v 12 Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,
\p
\v 13 And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.
\p
\v 14 Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
\p
\v 15 ¶ And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known to the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.
\p
\v 16 But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known to the high priest, and spoke to her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.
\p
\v 17 Then said the damsel that kept the door to Peter, Are not you also one of this man's disciples? He said, I am not.
\p
\v 18 And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.
\p
\v 19 ¶ The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.
\p
\v 20 Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, where the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.
\p
\v 21 Why ask you me? ask them which heard me, what I have said to them: behold, they know what I said.
\p
\v 22 And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answer you the high priest so?
\p
\v 23 Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smite you me?
\p
\v 24 Now Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
\p
\v 25 And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore to him, Are not you also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.
\p
\v 26 One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, said, Did not I see you in the garden with him?
\p
\v 27 Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.
\p
\v 28 ¶ Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas to the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.
\p
\v 29 Pilate then went out to them, and said, What accusation bring you against this man?
\p
\v 30 They answered and said to him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up to you.
\p
\v 31 Then said Pilate to them, Take you him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:
\p
\v 32 That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying what death he should die.
\p
\v 33 Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?
\p
\v 34 Jesus answered him, Say you this thing of yourself, or did others tell it you of me?
\p
\v 35 Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you to me: what have you done?
\p
\v 36 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.
\p
\v 37 Pilate therefore said to him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth hears my voice.
\p
\v 38 Pilate said to him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, I find in him no fault at all.
\p
\v 39 But you have a custom, that I should release to you one at the passover: will you therefore that I release to you the King of the Jews?
\p
\v 40 Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.
\p
\v 2 And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,
\p
\v 3 And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.
\p
\v 4 Pilate therefore went forth again, and said to them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that you may know that I find no fault in him.
\p
\v 5 Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, Behold the man!
\p
\v 6 When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate said to them, Take you him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.
\p
\v 7 The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.
\p
\v 8 When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;
\p
\v 9 And went again into the judgment hall, and said to Jesus, From where are you? But Jesus gave him no answer.
\p
\v 10 Then said Pilate to him, Speak you not to me? know you not that I have power to crucify you, and have power to release you?
\p
\v 11 Jesus answered, You could have no power at all against me, except it were given you from above: therefore he that delivered me to you has the greater sin.
\p
\v 12 And from thereafter Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend: whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.
\p
\v 13 When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.
\p
\v 14 And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he said to the Jews, Behold your King!
\p
\v 15 But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.
\p
\v 16 Then delivered he him therefore to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.
\p
\v 17 And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:
\p
\v 18 Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the middle.
\p
\v 19 ¶ And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.
\p
\v 20 This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was near to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.
\p
\v 21 Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.
\p
\v 22 Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.
\p
\v 23 ¶ Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
\p
\v 24 They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which said, They parted my raiment among them, and for my clothing they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.
\p
\v 25 ¶ Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.
\p
\v 26 When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he said to his mother, Woman, behold your son!
\p
\v 27 Then said he to the disciple, Behold your mother! And from that hour that disciple took her to his own home.
\p
\v 28 ¶ After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst.
\p
\v 29 Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it on hyssop, and put it to his mouth.
\p
\v 30 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.
\p
\v 31 The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) sought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
\p
\v 32 Then came the soldiers, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.
\p
\v 33 But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they broke not his legs:
\p
\v 34 But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and immediately came there out blood and water.
\p
\v 35 And he that saw it bore record, and his record is true: and he knows that he said true, that you might believe.
\p
\v 36 For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.
\p
\v 37 And again another scripture said, They shall look on him whom they pierced.
\p
\v 38 ¶ And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, sought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.
\p
\v 39 And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.
\p
\v 40 Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.
\p
\v 41 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulcher, wherein was never man yet laid.
\p
\v 42 There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulcher was near at hand.
\c 20
\p
\v 1 The first day of the week comes Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, to the sepulcher, and sees the stone taken away from the sepulcher.
\p
\v 2 Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.
\p
\v 3 Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulcher.
\p
\v 4 So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulcher.
\p
\v 5 And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.
\p
\v 6 Then comes Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulcher, and sees the linen clothes lie,
\p
\v 7 And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.
\p
\v 8 Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulcher, and he saw, and believed.
\p
\v 9 For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.
\p
\v 10 Then the disciples went away again to their own home.
\p
\v 11 ¶ But Mary stood without at the sepulcher weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulcher,
\p
\v 12 And sees two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
\p
\v 13 And they say to her, Woman, why weep you? She said to them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they have laid him.
\p
\v 14 And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
\p
\v 15 Jesus said to her, Woman, why weep you? whom seek you? She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, Sir, if you have borne him hence, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.
\p
\v 16 Jesus said to her, Mary. She turned herself, and said to him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.
\p
\v 17 Jesus said to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brothers, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.
\p
\v 18 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the LORD, and that he had spoken these things to her.
\p
\v 19 ¶ Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the middle, and said to them, Peace be to you.
\p
\v 20 And when he had so said, he showed to them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD.
\p
\v 21 Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be to you: as my Father has sent me, even so send I you.
\p
\v 22 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, Receive you the Holy Ghost:
\p
\v 23 Whose soever sins you remit, they are remitted to them; and whose soever sins you retain, they are retained.
\p
\v 24 ¶ But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
\p
\v 25 The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the LORD. But he said to them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.
\p
\v 26 ¶ And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the middle, and said, Peace be to you.
\p
\v 27 Then said he to Thomas, Reach here your finger, and behold my hands; and reach here your hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.
\p
\v 28 And Thomas answered and said to him, My LORD and my God.
\p
\v 29 Jesus said to him, Thomas, because you have seen me, you have believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.
\p
\v 30 ¶ And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:
\p
\v 31 But these are written, that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you might have life through his name.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise showed he himself.
\p
\v 2 There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.
\p
\v 3 Simon Peter said to them, I go a fishing. They say to him, We also go with you. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.
\p
\v 4 But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
\p
\v 5 Then Jesus said to them, Children, have you any meat? They answered him, No.
\p
\v 6 And he said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and you shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
\p
\v 7 Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat to him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.
\p
\v 8 And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.
\p
\v 9 As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.
\p
\v 10 Jesus said to them, Bring of the fish which you have now caught.
\p
\v 11 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.
\p
\v 12 Jesus said to them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples dared ask him, Who are you? knowing that it was the Lord.
\p
\v 13 Jesus then comes, and takes bread, and gives them, and fish likewise.
\p
\v 14 This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.
\p
\v 15 ¶ So when they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me more than these? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Feed my lambs.
\p
\v 16 He said to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Feed my sheep.
\p
\v 17 He said to him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Love you me? And he said to him, Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you. Jesus said to him, Feed my sheep.
\p
\v 18 Truly, truly, I say to you, When you were young, you gird yourself, and walked where you would: but when you shall be old, you shall stretch forth your hands, and another shall gird you, and carry you where you would not.
\p
\v 19 This spoke he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he said to him, Follow me.
\p
\v 20 Then Peter, turning about, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrays you?
\p
\v 21 Peter seeing him said to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?
\p
\v 22 Jesus said to him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to you? follow you me.
\p
\v 23 Then went this saying abroad among the brothers, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not to him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to you?
\p
\v 24 This is the disciple which testifies of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.
